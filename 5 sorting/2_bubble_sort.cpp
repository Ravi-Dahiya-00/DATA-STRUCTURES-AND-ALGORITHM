/*
    👉 Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
    It’s called “bubble” sort because the largest element “bubbles up” to the end of the array in each pass.  
        Start from the first element of the array.

        Compare the current element with the next one.
        If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
        Continue this process for the entire array.
        After the first pass, the largest element will be at the end.
        Repeat the process for the remaining elements (ignoring the already sorted last elements).
        Continue until the entire array is sorted.

        Time Complexity
        Best Case (already sorted): O(n) (with optimization check)
        Worst Case: O(n²)

        O(1) → because sorting happens in place, no extra space needed.
